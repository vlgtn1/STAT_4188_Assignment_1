I think that Tom Golway means that the data science today deals with very complex and difficult problems, so we have to know broades context about the issue, in addition to data sciecne methods and techniques.
Because of the lack of context, one can confuse correlation and causation - meaning that two variables may be just statistically associated with each other, but we will think that one of them caused another, which will lead us to incorrect inferences. The knowledge about the issue outside the statistical analysis could prevent that.
